## Evaluation rubric

We'll evaluate the projects with the following criteria:

1. Consistent progress (did the team post constant and engaging updates?)
2. Usefulness (does the app solve a real problem?)
3. User experience (is the app easy to use?)
4. Technical prowess (is this technically challenging?)


## Reporting Progress

We'll evaluate progress along the hackathon, so ensure your teams posts constant
updates on social media for us to monitor progress. It's ok to post small updates. Here are some examples:

> We're participating in #PloomberPanelHackathon2024 by building {{DESCRIPTION}}! We're just getting started but here's our repository {{URL}} #TeamName

> We just built the basic UI for our project, check it out {{APP URL}}! #PloomberPanelHackathon2024 #TeamName

> We added the ability to do {{SOMETHING}} to our app, check the recording or try it live {{APP URL}}! #PloomberPanelHackathon2024 #TeamName

Tips to make your updates better:

- Include a screen recording to show your work, or even better, a deployed application (you don't have to finish the app to showcase it!)
- Don't forget to include the `#PloomberPanelHackathon2024` and `#TeamName` hashtags!
