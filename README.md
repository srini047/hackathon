# Ploomber <> Panel Hackathon

This document explains everything you need about the Ploomber <> Panel Hackathon.

## Individual Registration

To participate in the hackathon, you must submit the sign-up form. Registration closes
on March 15th, 2024. Participants will receive a confirmation over the weekend, and
we’ll begin the Hackathon on March 18th, 2024.

## Rules

- Code must be open-source
- You must participate solo or in teams of 2 or 3
- The app must use [Panel](https://github.com/holoviz/panel)
- The app must be deployed to [Ploomber Cloud](https://ploomber.io/)
- We're pretty open to topics, but feel free to [discuss your idea](#getting-help). Some topics we like are LLM-powered applications, data visualization, Machine Learning, and scientific computing. For inspiration, check out [Panel's examples](https://panel.holoviz.org/gallery/index.html)

## Confirm your participation

If you're looking for teammates, join Panel’s Discord to pitch your idea.

Someone from each team should **open a PR** to this repository and themselves to the [Teams](#teams) section.

## Teams

Add a new section to register your team, here's an example:

Team Name: Healthy Ploomber
Members: David Tang
Project description: Data visualization of health research relating to ageing. Aiming to have a deployed, reproducible and open-source app with code available.
Github repo: https://github.com/dcstang/dash_bhs

### {{TEAM NAME}}

Members: {{LIST OF NAMES}}

Project description: {{2-3 sentences describing your project}}

Link to GitHub repository: {{URL TO A PUBLIC REPOSITORY}}

## Evaluation rubric

We'll evaluate the projects with the following criteria:

1. Consistent progress (did the team post constant and engaging updates?)
2. Usefulness (does the app solve a real problem?)
3. User experience (is the app easy to use?)
4. Technical prowess (is this technically challenging?)


## Reporting Progress

We'll evaluate progress along the hackathon, so ensure your teams posts constant
updates on social media for us to monitor progress. It's ok to post small updates. Here are some examples:

> We're participating in #PloomberPanelHackathon2024 by building {{DESCRIPTION}}! We're just getting started but here's our repository {{URL}} #TeamName

> We just built the basic UI for our project, check it out {{APP URL}}! #PloomberPanelHackathon2024 #TeamName

> We added the ability to do {{SOMETHING}} to our app, check the recording or try it live {{APP URL}}! #PloomberPanelHackathon2024 #TeamName

Tips to make your updates better:

- Include a screen recording to show your work, or even better, a deployed application (you don't have to finish the app to showcase it!)
- Don't forget to include the `#PloomberPanelHackathon2024` and `#TeamName` hashtags!

## Getting Help

If you need help with Panel, join [Panel's Discord](https://discord.gg/UXdtYyGVQX) (there is a [ploomber-hackathon](https://discord.gg/CDKq8FjUvV) channel),

## Submitting your work

You must submit your work by March 31st 11:59PM [anywhere on Earth.](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth)
